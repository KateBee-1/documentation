# Centrifuge Governance
Governance in Centrifuge refers to both the on-chain voting and off-chain coordination used to govern (both Centrifuge and Altair). Governance refers to any activity taken to propose changes to the protocol or ecosystem. These include but are not limited to; the Centrifuge chain, CFG token reward rates, runtime upgrades, integrations, chain parameters, transactions fees, and governance parameters.

To make significant changes to the network, active token holders and the council must go through both the off-chain and on-chain governance process. No matter whether the proposal is made by the public (token holders) or by the council, the final step is a referendum that enables all holders (their influence weighted by stake) to make the decision.

Centrifuge governance is based on the Polkadot model which is explained in full here. Basically it attempts to mitigate two key problems in blockchain governance: many proposals (or proposal spam) and low voter turnout. 

This functions like democracy as we know it with one-person having one vote and ‘winning’ referenda requiring a majority-of-votes. However, actors can increase the impact of their votes by holding and staking more tokens.

### Altair Governance

The governance of the Altair Network uses the AIR token largely functions the same as the governance of Centrifuge with a few different parameters: mostly the speed at which it operates is faster. This document also applies to Altair and where they exist, differences are highlighted.

## Who can participate in governance and what can they do?

Community member (ie anyone who considers themselves part of the Centrifuge community):
- Start a discussion, indicate preference in polls, and comment on any proposal on the Centrifuge governance forum. 

CFG holders:
Community members (ie anyone who considers themselves part of the Centrifuge community):
- Start a discussion
- Indicate preference in polls
- Comment on any proposal on the Centrifuge governance forum. 

CFG and AIR holders:
- Propose a public referendum
- Prioritize public referenda
- Vote on all active referenda
- Vote for council members
- Become a council member
The more CFG you hold, the more ‘weight’ you have in governance. Participants can also stake their CFG to validate on the network. This is called “nominating”.

Council Members or Councilors:
- Represent passive token holder
- Vote on referenda directly
- Propose referenda from community members
- Propose their own referenda
- Veto proposals


## The Council and Council Elections

The council should referenda beneficial to the Centrifuge Network, based on member's expertise and experience in developing, maintaining and using Centrifuge. The council serves to represent the interest of all Centrifuge stakeholders, be they actively participating token holders or not.

The Centrifuge Chain Council comprises a body of 7 elected members and Altair council 9 members who have the ability to vote on certain things directly and they can propose motions that token holders vote on. 

Council members have the ability to veto incoming proposals. After a cool-down period of 7 days, however, these proposals can be re-submitted, and the council member that vetoed the proposal cannot veto this proposal again. If a council members vetos,  after a cool-down period of 7 days, however, these proposals can be re-submitted, and the council member that vetoed the proposal cannot veto this proposal again.

Proposals that do not pass a majority within the council do not make it to a public referendum. In situations where the council is in unanimous agreement, proposals only need to pass a less-than-majority threshold in a public vote for approval. When only a majority of council members vote Yes (or aye) on a given proposal, the public must approve of the motion with a simple majority.

Any CFG holder can become elected to the council or AIR holder to the Altair Council. 

For more information on the process of becoming a councillor and on voting for councillors on Centrifuge and Altair see the Polkadot governance documentation (https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/learn-governance)

## Voting in Altair Council Elections

### How much AIR can I bond (to vote) with? 
As much as you want 

### Will I get this bond back? 
Yes

### Can I vote with staked tokens?
Yes you can vote with staked tokens. It’s important though not to vote with your full balance. because otherwise you can’t put for the unlock transaction

### How long should I bond in order for it to get counted?
You can vote with as many tokens as you want, and they will simply be bonded and unbonded as you choose. The bonding period is 0 so you can unbond anytime, however, when you unbond your vote no longer impacts the voting outcome.

### How often do we elect councillors?
There is a new election term every week. So any runners up with higher votes become ‘councilors’ and councillors who have less votes move down into ‘candidates’. 

## How the bond occurs towards election

A Centrifuge Chain Council candidate submits their candidacy with 1000 CFG bond and an Altair candidate 500 AIR (The bond will be reserved for the duration of your candidacy and membership).

If you are not elected this bond will be forfeit (burnt)

Token holders can vote for candidates (current members as well as new candidates)

When the term is about to be changed, which is every 7 days for Centrifuge and every 10 for Altair, votes are counted and top 7 or 9 candidates will be elected as new council members until next term.

Token holders can change their votes anytime and the change will be reflected in the next term.

## Prosopsing Referenda and Voting

### Referenda
On-chain referenda are like proposals that any token holder can submit to be voted on. Referenda are made by either the Council or the public. Every launch period (7 days), a proposal is tabled for voting from either the Council or the public, prioritising the one that did not get tabled in the previous period. As a result, the Council controls 50% of the legislative agenda and the public the other 50%.

Any token holder can submit a proposal for a public referenda by staking 500 CFG or 500 AIR towards their proposal. Other token holders can second this proposal by staking the same amount. With each launch period, currently 7 days, the proposal with the greatest stake weight behind it is selected for the public queue.

Each referendum has a specific proposal associated with it. Referenda can be started in one of several ways:

- As publicly submitted proposals;
- As proposals submitted by the council, either through a majority or unanimously;
- As proposals submitted as part of the enactment of a prior referendum;
- As proposals that are fast-tracked by the council if deemed necessary, through super-majority. Fast tracking means that unless 100% of CFG holders vote, a super majority (>50%) is required to pass referenda. If there is 100% voter turnout a simple 50% majority carries. Basically, the lower the turnout, the greater percentage of yes votes there needs to be (the inverse is also true).

Referenda are open for 7 days, unless fast-tracked. The fast tracked referenda open voting period is set by the council for each proposal and can be as short as 3 hours.

Token holders vote on referenda proposed by the community with their tokens and increase the weight of their vote by locking up CGF or AIR for extended periods of time (this is what stake-weighted voting means). 


### How can I propose a referendum?

Public referenda can be proposed by any token holder by bonding 500 CFG or AIR (you can use vested CFG or AIR but not staked), once the proposal has been made, the tokens are locked until the proposal has been bonded. The proposal with the highest bond gets elected to be voted on next. 

In order to go ahead, public referenda proposed by token holders must be seconded by supporting token holders, ie. if someone agrees with the proposal, they may deposit the same amount of tokens to support it — this action is called seconding. 

The proposal with the highest amount of support will be selected to be a referendum in the next voting cycle. The problem of proposal spam is lessened by prioritizing the proposals with the greatest weight behind them and ensures that the most desired proposals get voted on first.

Every launch period, a referenda is tabled from either the queue of Council motioned referenda or Democracy motioned referenda, thus the Council controls 50% of the agenda and the public the other 50%.

Once a public referedum has been bonded and seconded, voting can begin. 

#### Enactment Delay

Every approved referendum goes through a certain amount of time before it becomes enacted on-chain. This allows participants who disagree with any referenda to leave the network. CFG in support of this referenda is locked, at a minimum, until the upgrade is enacted.

Voters should carefully choose what proposals they vote for, and keep in mind what the impact referenda will have on the health of the entire Centrifuge network (including Altair).

The current enactment delay period on Centrifuge Chain and Altair is 8 days.

#### Fast Tracking

In unexpected conditions where legislative changes need to be made quickly, proposals can be brought to referendum immediately and in parallel to the normal monthly proposals. In the case of approval by a super-majority (>3/4) of the Council, a proposal may be fast-tracked and put to vote in the Referendum chamber immediately, with a far shorter voting period to normal and a near zero enactment period.

The minimum voting period on Centrifuge Chain is currently ~3 hours.

## Voting

Voting on chain functions like democracy as we know it with one-person having one vote and ‘winning’ referenda requiring a majority-of-votes. However, actors can increase the impact of their votes by holding and staking more CFG. 

Clicking on `Vote` next to each referenda will open a dialog with following options

- Vote with account: Account you want use to vote on a Referendum
- Vote value: Amount of CFG you want to associate with this vote. The vote value of all votes decides whether a referendum passes or not at the end of voting period

To vote for a proposal in a referendum, CFG and AIR holders must lock tokens along with their vote.

As long as a user has the amount of CFG in their account either locked or unlocked or vesting, they can use it for democracy votes. Locked tokens used to vote have a lockup period, and in Centrifuge one lock period is 7 days during which any CFG holder can vote, and Altair’s will be decided by AIR holders.  

Token holders must submit a transaction to unlock their tokens once the lock period has ended.

Read more about stake-based voting schemes built with the Polkadot Governance mechanism [here](https://crates.io/crates/pallet-democracy).


### Time lock voting
Time-lock voting is implemented in order to ensure that some minimal economic buy-in to the result is needed and to dissuade vote selling. It is possible to vote without locking at all, for a heavy discount (90%) on the voting weight of the tokens. To use the full weight of the tokens, they must be locked for the entire enactment delay period beyond the end of the referendum.

For public referenda, the positive turnout bias requires a heavy supermajority of aye votes to carry at low turnouts, but as turnout increases towards 100%, it becomes a simple majority-carries. We call this a “positive” turnout bias because the required margin of ayes increases as turnout increases. Based on the voting result, the proposal will be approved and autonomously enact

> - Holders can check the end of their lock period by querying the chain state with `democracy.locks(AccountId)` which returns the block number that the lock is active until
> - Once the lock period has passed, any holder can call `democracy.unlock(addr)` to unlock the tokens
> 
### Conviction
When someone votes on a referendum via Democracy, they can choose the conviction of their vote. The lock period is based on the level of conviction you want to associate with this vote

For example:

- If you want to vote Aye/Nay with 100 CFG with 0.1x conviction, then 0.1*100 = 10 CFG is the vote value with no lock on CFG
- If you want to vote Aye/Nay with 100 CFG with 1x conviction, then 1 * 100 = 100 CFG is the vote value with 8 day lockup of 100 CFG
- If you want to vote Aye/nay with 100 CFG with 2x conviction, then 2 * 100 = 200 CFG is the vote value with 2 * 8 day lockup of 100 CFG

Please select the appropriate conviction when voting on the referendum

Referenda can be found onchain under Governance -> Democracy -> Referenda. Voters can vote with higher conviction to have their vote count.


#### How do votes succeed?

The vote needed to pass is generally adaptive to the voter turnout (this is referred to as adaptive quorum biasing). Depending on which entity proposed the proposal and whether all council members voted yes, there are three different scenarios. We can use the following table for reference.

<img width="639" alt="Gov proposing entity" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84034484/146755270-4917724a-b210-457f-a8eb-cb06e03a8970.png">

Votes are weighed based on 2 criteria:

1. The number of tokens locked
2. The amount of time these tokens will remained locked after the referendum

## Governance Process
What do we govern as a community and what are the relevant processes for each?

- 'Parameters of the System' ie changing enactment period
- Change governance process
- Runtime upgrades
- Integrations with other chains
- Council elections
- CFG Rewards

### What is the process for getting a proposal passed? 

In simple terms the flow is as follows - off chain consultation > proposal of referenda > voting > enactment

Centrifuge uses an on-chain governance model with off-chain consultation, which means that first there must be a discussion off-chain (on the Centrifuge Forum, see below), and then the initiator can turn their initiative into a proposal (on-chain) to be voted on by the Chain Council.

<img width="694" alt="Governance process" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/84034484/146743045-065d3331-5d4c-414c-8f35-d2037bb17ea8.png">

The Governance Process steps are explained in more detail below:

### Step One: Temperature Check
_(On the Forum)_

In the Centrifuge Forum under the Governance section. Use the subcategories in the Governance category to correctly tag your proposal. Making an Temperature Check involves outlining the topic of discussion, your proposed way forward, and giving enough detail for people to start discussing. After you have made your Temperature Check, post it in relevant channels including discord to attract relevant users. After at least 3 days of discussion, move to step 2. 


### Step Two: Proposal 
_(On the Forum)_

After the initiator of the proposal decides there has been enough discussion (a week is an ideal amount of time), the next step is to post a Yes/No or multiple choice proposal in the form of a ‘poll’ (still on the Forum) with different poll options and a clear time period, excluding anonymous voting. 

For any recurring votes, ensure the time of the next proposal is clear for all stakeholders. Forum polls serve to inform the council and token holders about the preferences of the community which are then put forward as proposals to be voted on. If the council strongly disagrees with a poll outcome, in the interests of the health of the ecosystem it can downvote the proposal. Forum polls are non binding off-chain signals.

### Step Three: Submit Proposal 
_(On chain)_

Based on the outcome of your poll proposal, either submit your proposal to the Centrifuge Chain Council or Alrair Council using the relevant governance channels on discord, for them to consider or you can submit the proposal directly.

Once vote is approved then forward approved proposal to governance channel on discord for onchain voting

### Step Four: Publicize Your Proposal
_(On chain)_

Once your proposal has been selected for referendum, publicize that the vote is live in the Forum in the Proposals section and ask token holders to vote via the governance channel on Discord.
